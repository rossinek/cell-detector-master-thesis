# Mycobacterial cell detection and tracking in ImageJ
### Master thesis in Polish

Tuberculosis and other diseases caused by the genus Mycobacterium remains a serious worldwide problem. Basic research aimed at understanding the biology of Mycobacteria is very important for further work related to novel drug development. The important part of this kind of research is the process of obtaining data from microscopic recordings of the cell cycle of model organisms.

This is my master thesis **in Polish**. This paper and a plugin that was created as part of it aims to simplify this process and create a code base that can be used for further development. The tool was created as a plugin for the ImageJ – program that is widely used by the scientific community.
